;;;; Criterium - measures expression computation time over multiple invocations

;;;; Inspired by Brent Broyer's

;;;; and also Haskell's Criterion

;;;; Unlike java solutions, this can benchmark general expressions rather than

  "Criterium measures the computation time of an expression.  It is
designed to address some of the pitfalls of benchmarking, and benchmarking on
the JVM in particular.

This includes:
  - statistical processing of multiple evaluations
  - inclusion of a warm-up period, designed to allow the JIT compiler to
    optimise its code
  - purging of gc before testing, to isolate timings from GC state prior
    to testing
  - a final forced GC after testing to estimate impact of cleanup on the
    timing results

Usage:
  (use 'criterium.core)
  (bench (Thread/sleep 1000) :verbose)
  (with-progress-reporting (bench (Thread/sleep 1000) :verbose))
  (report-result (benchmark (Thread/sleep 1000)) :verbose)
  (report-result (quick-bench (Thread/sleep 1000)))

benchmarking pitfalls.

See http://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion for a Haskell benchmarking

  The idea is that except for the call to (f), the only things done during each

  longs, and the storage of the return value.

  The JVM is not free to optimize away the calls to f because the return values

  This array is at most +max-obj-array-size+ elements long, to save
