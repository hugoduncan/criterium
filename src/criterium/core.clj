;;;; Criterium - measures expression computation time over multiple invocations

;;;; Inspired by Brent Broyer's
;;;; http://www.ellipticgroup.com/html/benchmarkingArticle.html
;;;; and also Haskell's Criterion

;;;; Unlike java solutions, this can benchmark general expressions rather than
;;;; just functions.

  "Criterium measures the computation time of an expression.  It is
  designed to address some of the pitfalls of benchmarking, and benchmarking on
  the JVM in particular.

  This includes:
  - statistical processing of multiple evaluations
  - inclusion of a warm-up period, designed to allow the JIT compiler to
    optimise its code
  - purging of gc before testing, to isolate timings from GC state prior
    to testing
  - a final forced GC after testing to estimate impact of cleanup on the
    timing results

  Usage:
  (use 'criterium.core)
  (bench (Thread/sleep 1000) :verbose)
  (with-progress-reporting (bench (Thread/sleep 1000) :verbose))
  (report-result (benchmark (Thread/sleep 1000)) :verbose)
  (report-result (quick-bench (Thread/sleep 1000)))

  See http://www.ellipticgroup.com/html/benchmarkingArticle.html for a Java
  benchmarking library.  The accompanying article describes many of the JVM
  benchmarking pitfalls.

  See http://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion for a Haskell benchmarking
  library that applies many of the same statistical techniques."
